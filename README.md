Classroom Networking Simulation – Cisco Packet Tracer
This project is a Classroom Networking Simulation designed using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates an efficient and secure network setup for a classroom environment, integrating key networking concepts such as DHCP, VPN, Firewalls, VLANs, and Routing.

📌 Features
✔ DHCP Configuration – Automatic IP allocation for student and teacher devices.
✔ VLAN Segmentation – Separate networks for students, teachers, and servers.
✔ VPN (Virtual Private Network) – Secure remote access for authorized users.
✔ Firewall (ASA 5505) – Security layer to protect internal network resources.
✔ Routing & Switching – Implemented using Routers, Switches, and Access Points.
✔ Server Room – DNS, FTP, Email, and Registration Servers.
✔ Printers & Smartboards – Integrated for classroom use.

🔧 Technologies Used
Cisco Packet Tracer (Networking Simulation)
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
Virtual LAN (VLAN)
Firewall (ASA 5505)
VPN for Secure Remote Access
Routing Protocols for Connectivity
📷 Network Topology
The network consists of:
📍 Student Desks – Each connected to a switch with DHCP-enabled PCs.
📍 Teacher Desk – Includes a laptop, printer, and smartboard.
📍 Server Room – Hosts various servers for classroom activities.
📍 Core Router & Switches – Manage interconnections and traffic flow.

🚀 How to Use
1️⃣ Open the Packet Tracer (.pkt) file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2️⃣ Observe the network topology and configurations.
3️⃣ Test connectivity using ping and traceroute commands.
4️⃣ Modify and expand as per your networking requirements.

🏆 Learning Outcomes
✅ Understanding of DHCP, VLANs, and Firewalls.
✅ Hands-on experience with Cisco routers and switches.
✅ Implementing secure and structured networking environments.
